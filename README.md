# Roman Architecture by Diana E.E. Kleiner

There was a set of lecture notes taken during the [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/course/romanarchitecture) *Roman Architecture by Prof. Diana E. E. Kleiner*. Because of the censorship politics introduced by one of the TAs of the course, [Joe Rosenthal](https://www.coursera.org/user/i/3eb1c2d17e8b49566d2aeccc9be4e3ee), the notes were deleted.
